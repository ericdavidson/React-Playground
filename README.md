# Eric's React Playground

Don't get your hopes up about this project, I'm just using it to learn and lightly document some cool aspects of React.

Right now the table will be populated with random data and if you click one of the rows it will "update" by re-generating.

To run the project:

> npm start

The documentation/comments represent the initial commit and will be updated as I learn more next week.
